## Statement of Purpose

This site will act as a landing page for all prospective members of the UCSD Wrestling Club. It should look cohesive, professional, and most importantly provide up-to-date information about the club. It should act a single source of truth for who we are, how to join, and possibly upcoming practice/competition schedules. Core to the aim of the site is making the club's existence and mission clear to anyone interested in wrestling at UC San Diego.

## Audience Considerations

Our target audience is tiered as follows:
1. Prospective athletes - Our central goal is to make getting involved with the club straightforward and uncomplicated. We will direct visitors towards information on joining above the fold on the front page of the site, and provide clear links to the groupme, instagram, etc.
2. Parents and Sponsors - Those interested in supporting the club but not joining should have plenty of information about what the club is currently up to and how to donate. Potentially we will start a monthly (quarterly?) newsletter, and if so, the site should instruct people on how to sign up for that.
3. Current athletes - We expect current members to be involved on the existing GroupMe for immediate communication/updates. However, the current/upcoming schedule of practices should be available on the website to reference if a current athlete is curious
